<h2>HTML & Making a website</h2>

Making this website.

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>
Writing for this website, and just in general trying to practice writing my ideas and thoughts in a cohesive way.
I want to be a writer in the way Derek Sivers and Cal Newport are writers so here I am trying to practice.

<h2>Creating this website</h2>
<p>
I am just starting this website. I want to make it a good collection of my thoughts and a place to write my ideas and things I learn.
I also want it to be a place I can learn html, and make a cool fun website of my own design.
