<h1>What I'm doing now</h1>

Updated May 31st 2024, from my parents house in Calgary, Canada.
</p>
<h2>Spending time with family</h2>
<p>
I just got back from my 11 month trip through Southeast Asia & Europe.
So I am living at home and trying to spend lots of time with family.
</p>
<h2>Reading lots</h2>
<p>
I have a ton of books from my storage boxes I am trying to work through.
I am loving the feeling of reading physical books again after being E-reader only for the past year.
</p>
<h2>Stoicism</h2>
<p>
I have been reading tons of books on Stoicism at the end of my trip and now I am really enjoying having the physical copies of 
Seneca's letters, Epictetus' Discourses and Handbook, and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.
Reading a few passages or a letter everyday is like a nice calming ointment for the mind.
</p>
<h2>Creating this website</h2>
<p>
I am just starting this website. I want to make it a good collection of my thoughts and a place to write my ideas and things I learn.
I also want it to be a place I can learn html, and make a cool fun website of my own design.
